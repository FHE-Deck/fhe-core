Compile:

With Ubuntu 20.4 from scratch:

sudo apt-get install  build-essential

sudo apt-get install libntl-dev

sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

sudo apt-get install fftw-dev (I run this before the libfftw3-dev) but it didn't compile. I don't know whether this fftw-dev is needed.

Then install Intel Hexl from [link](https://github.com/intel/hexl).
